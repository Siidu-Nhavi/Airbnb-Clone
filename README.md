🏡 Airbnb Clone – Full-Stack Web Application

A full-stack Airbnb-inspired web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed information, and authenticate securely.
The project focuses on clean backend architecture, scalable structure, and real-world authentication patterns using modern web technologies.

This application is built as a learning-plus-production-ready project to understand how large platforms like Airbnb manage listings, users, sessions, and UI rendering.

🎯 Project Objective

1.The goal of this project is to:
2.Build a real-world full-stack application
3.Understand RESTful routing and MVC architecture
4.Implement secure authentication and session management
5.Work with MongoDB Atlas and cloud-based persistence
6.Develop a scalable backend structure suitable for future features


🚀 Features Implemented

🖥️ Frontend (UI & UX)

->Fully responsive UI using Bootstrap
->Airbnb-style layout and navigation
->Dynamic rendering using EJS templates
->Flash messages for success and error feedback
->Clean, reusable partials (navbar, alerts, layouts)

🏠 Property Listings Module

->View all available property listings
->Individual listing detail pages
->Add new listings with images
->Edit existing listings
->Delete listings
->Images integrated using Unsplash
->Data stored and managed via MongoDB

## 🔐 User Authentication & Authorization (Session-Based)

Wanderlust implements a **secure session-based authentication system** using **Passport.js** and **MongoDB** to manage user login state and access control.

---

### ✨ Features Implemented
- User signup with **username, email, and password**
- Secure login using **Passport.js (Local Strategy)**
- Password hashing and salting with **passport-local-mongoose**
- Session management using **express-session**
- Persistent session storage using **connect-mongo**
- Flash messages for authentication success and errors
- Automatic redirect after successful login
- Fully implemented **User model** and **authentication routes**
- Protected routes using authorization middleware

---
 🔄 How Session-Based Authentication Works

### 1️⃣ User Registration
- Users sign up by providing a username, email, and password.
- Passwords are **hashed and salted** automatically using `passport-local-mongoose`.
- User data is stored securely in MongoDB.

---

### 2️⃣ User Login (Authentication)
- User submits login credentials.
- Passport.js:
  - Fetches the user from MongoDB.
  - Verifies the password against the stored hash.
- On success, Passport authenticates the user and initiates a session.

---

### 3️⃣ Session Creation
- After successful authentication:
  - A **session ID** is generated by the server.
  - The session ID is stored in the browser as a **cookie**.
- No sensitive data is stored on the client.

---

### 4️⃣ Session Storage (MongoDB)
- Sessions are stored in MongoDB using **connect-mongo**.
- This enables:
  - Persistent login across server restarts.
  - Scalability for production deployment.

---

### 5️⃣ Session Persistence
- On every request:
  - The browser sends the session cookie automatically.
  - Express-session retrieves session data from MongoDB.
  - Passport restores the logged-in user using:
    - `serializeUser()`
    - `deserializeUser()`
- The authenticated user is accessible via:
```js
req.user

6️⃣ Authorization (Protected Routes)

>>Protected routes use middleware to check authentication:

req.isAuthenticated()

Authenticated users can:
-Create listings.
-Edit or delete their own listings.
-Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page with a flash message.

7️⃣ Flash Messages
Flash messages provide feedback for:
-Successful login or signup.
-Authentication and authorization errors.
-Messages persist for one request only, improving user experience.

8️⃣ Logout
When a user logs out:
-The session is destroyed.
-The session cookie is cleared.
-The user is redirected safely.

✅ Why Session-Based Authentication?
-Secure server-side session handling
-Prevents exposure of sensitive data on the client
-Ideal for server-rendered applications (EJS)
-Easily extendable to role-based authorization (Admin/User)

🚀 Deployment Guide

This project is designed to be easily deployed on modern cloud platforms such as Render, Railway, or Vercel (backend-only).

🌐 Deployment on Render (Recommended)
1️⃣ Create a Web Service

1.Go to Render Dashboard.
2.Click New → Web Service.
3.Connect your GitHub repository.

2️⃣ Configure Build Settings
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start

3️⃣ Add Environment Variables
In Render → Environment → Add:

ATLASDB_URL=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_secret
NODE_ENV=production

4️⃣ MongoDB Atlas Configuration
Add your Render IP (or 0.0.0.0/0) to Atlas Network Access
Ensure the correct database user and password are set


🚄 Deployment on Railway (Alternative)
1.Create a new project.
2.Connect GitHub repository.
3.Add the same environment variables.
4.Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys.


⚠️ Important Production Notes
1.Cookies are set with secure: true in production.
2.Sessions are persisted using connect-mongo.
3.MongoDB Atlas ensures data durability.
4.Flash messages and authentication remain intact after deployment.

🌍 Live URL (Optional)

✅ Why This Deployment Setup Is Production-Safe.

1.Stateless server with persistent sessions.
2.Secure cookies in production.
3.Cloud-hosted database (MongoDB Atlas).
4.Environment-variable–based secrets.
5.Scalable Express architecture.
